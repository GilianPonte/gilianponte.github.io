My name is Gilian Ponte, 24 years old and born/living in the Netherlands. Currently, I am a MSc Marketing student at Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. In my free time and work as a web analyst and data analyst I learned a lot about programming languages. For example, R, JavaScript and Python. These languages made my life a lot easier during my work experience and education. I especially appreciate the combination of new technology, statistics and marketing.

My goal with this blog is to write about this exciting combination of marketing and technology. Hopefully you will find these articles interesting and educational. If you ever want to reach out to me. You can send an email to gilianponte@gmail.com or go to my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilianponte/). I am always open to discuss, suggest or take suggestions and willing to share all the data.

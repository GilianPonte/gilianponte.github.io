Gilian Ponte is a Ph.D student at the Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Groningen (The Netherlands). My research interests lie in Marketing, Deep Learning and Applied Econometrics. My two excellent promotors are [Jaap Wieringa](https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.e.wieringa/) and [Tom Boot](https://sites.google.com/view/tomboot/home). My current research focuses on the development of methodologies to preserve privacy in marketing. Previously, I have worked for two years as a web analyst at Blokker Holding (a major retailer in the Netherlands).

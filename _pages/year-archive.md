Hi there! I'm Gilian Ponte, an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam. My research focuses on marketing analytics and privacy, with a special interest in differential privacy, econometrics, and machine learning. I explore how to balance data privacy with meaningful insights. One of my recent papers was a Best Paper Award finalist at the International Journal of Research in Marketing (2024), and my PhD dissertation received the EMAC Doctoral Dissertation Award.

I earned my PhD in Differential Privacy & Marketing Analytics at the University of Groningen, under the guidance of Prof. Jaap Wieringa and Dr. Tom Boot. During my PhD, I held a visiting researcher position at WU Vienna with Prof. Thomas Reutterer.

Before entering academia, I worked as a web analyst at Blokker Holding, a major Dutch retailer, where I focused on analytics implementation and company-wide insights.
What I value most in my work is contributing to privacy-related policymaking in collaboration with Dutch government agencies, including UWV, DUO, TNO, CBS, and the Ministry of Justice and Security. So if you are a policymaker, feel free to reach out!

I’m currently developing methods to quantify and manage privacy risks in experimental and modeling contexts, supported by grants from Google.

Outside of work, I enjoy music, race cycling, philosophy, reading, and good food—and luckily, the cycling helps balance out the food.
